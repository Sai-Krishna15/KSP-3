        <p><b>Title:</b>TIME AND ATTRIBUTE FACTORS COMBINED ACCESS CONTROL FOR TIME-SENSITIVE DATA IN PUBLIC CLOUD</p>
        <P><b>Description:</b><br>The new paradigm of outsourcing data to the cloud is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it frees data owners from the technical management, and is easier for data owners to share their data with intended users. On the other hand, it poses new challenges on privacy and security protection. However, till now, no schemes can support both fine-grained access control and time-sensitive data publishing. In this paper, by embedding timed-release encryption into Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE), we propose a new time and attribute factors combined access control on time-sensitive data for public cloud storage (named TAFC). Based on the proposed scheme, we further propose an efficient approach to design access policies faced with diverse access requirements for time-sensitive data. Extensive security and performance analysis shows that our proposed scheme is highly efficient and satisfies the security requirements for time-sensitive data storage in public cloud.</P>
